# TO-DO-app-java-spring-boot

This project is about a Backend service for a TO-DO app. The idea with this project is to review and reinforce my own
knowledge and abilities with the stack applied plus, when I start digging into a frontend framework, I will have a project 
to connect with it.

## Technologies used
- Language: Java 17
- Framework: Springboot
- IDE: IntelliJ
- DB: PostgresSQL

## Special note
This project is the first result of a strategy known as “Engineering Diary” that popped up in my social media algorithm one day. 
Surprisingly, it allowed me to develop consistency, enjoy the learning process, and revive the motivation I needed to reconnect 
with software development. After failing many times to study in a more practical way, having managed to build this project from 
scratch and really feel the learning process is personally a triumph for me.

## Context

The project structure is organized by feature, meaning that each participating entity has a classic 
layered structure that separates individual and shared responsibilities. In general terms, this is a TO-DO
app with typical elements like Boards, Phases, Tasks that will belong to a User and help him/her

The scope in terms of learning/review is aligned with people who intend to move beyond the junior 
level, as topics such as the following were addressed during the construction of this project:

- SOLID
- Efficient use of DTOs
- Efficient use of dependencies: MapStruct, Lombok
- Relational databases
- Implementation and management of validations with Exceptions
- Functional programming
- Unit testing
- Integration testing (Pending)
- Security (Pending)
- Swagger documentation (Pending)
- What's up with Java 21 and 24 (Pending)
